 project management or business analysis concepts
 
1. Focus on what individuals need to stop doing :
   If you need of loosing weight by exercise an hour day , you need to stop something else for an hour a day.
   
2. Simple or traumatic for you is probably not the same for others.

3. Understand what motivates you, but don't assume that same thing motivates others.
   Talk to your stakeholders and understand what motivates them before you take action relative to making change easier for them.
   
4. Tailor your change messages to accommodate individual needs.
   Some are auditory and want to hear about your change plans. 
   Others are better off experiencing a change. 
   They wanna touch and feel what it'll be like once the change is finished, so prototypes are ideal for them. 
   Others will want to see things presented visually. 
   Create your change message in various forms and you're more likely to get buy-in from a greater percentage of your stakeholders.
