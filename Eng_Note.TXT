1. Never pull off till tomorrow what you can do today.

2. Short as life is, we make it still shorter by the careless waste of time.
   by Victor Hugo.

3. Can I get you anything else ? No, thanks. VS. Thanks. I'm good.
      因為別人先前己經回答過你的問題，幫過忙了，這時說no太直接了，用一句"I am good."表示你剛剛給資訊已經夠了，也有感激之意。
      "I am good."和"I am fine."相通，但如果只用fine或是good，意思就完全相反。
4. You are telling me. 意思是「我早就知道，不用你告訴我。這還用你說嗎？」, 別錯解成「你正在告訴我」，就會愣在那兒以為別人話還沒說完。
5. Speak the same language. 我們想得一樣
      e.g. When we got down to planning where to go on our trip, I was glad we spoke the same language.（我很高興當我們決定行程的時候己經有共識。）
      
6. I'm copying you here so you can ...
   What questions do you have for me ?    

7.   - 目標要可靠，期望要實際
				Solid goal, practical expectation.
        Before setting a goal for your team, imagine what it'd be like if you're going to do it all by yourself. 
        Is it going to be hard or is it going to be easy? 
        After understanding your goals thoroughly, you can have a more practical expectation. 

     - 建立團隊互信
        Build trust within your team.
        Integration within a team always depends on trust. 
        Transparent and honest communication will not only benefit the team's efficiency but also the corporate culture.

		 - 解決導向
         Solution is the point.
 				When encountering a problem, or when team members make mistakes, remember not to focus on the problem itself but the solution to the issue. This is how employees learn to solve things themselves.

		 - 創造部屬的自信心
				Build (A) self-esteem in (B) underlings.
        Pay attention to how you make others feel. 
        An MVP in your team will never be just obedient, but will be confident and understand his or her own value.

     - 好的領導人不獨裁
        A good leader is not an autocrat.
        Being a competent leader doesn't mean you are going to throw your weight around. Finding a balance between being firm and being reasonable is a lesson that every leader should learn.
        做一個能幹的領導者並不代表要對他人頤指氣使。在立場堅定以及合乎情理間找到平衡點是優質領導人必學的一道課題。

     - 懂得賞識很重要
         Appreciation is important.
         Direct and plain feedback is necessary. So is appreciation. Encourage the positive cycle by telling the employee exactly what he did well.

     - 領導人也須「服務他人」
         Leaders need to serve others.
         There is a fallacy that the leader's job is to command. 
         Actually, a leader's main mission is to "serve." Offer the necessary information and give your team a hand when they are needed; that's how you make the team willing to support you in the same way.
 
     片語教學
       1. Under promise and over deliver
       不過度承諾，表現超乎期待 , Promise是承諾，Deliver是履行。

       Remember the principle of under promise and over deliver, and never make a promise that you cannot fulfill.
       謹記凡事要留有餘地，別做出自己無法履行的承諾。

       2. Throw one's weight around 逞威風
          指對人濫用自己的權威，表現跋扈或盛氣凌人。
          He is a bossy person who's always throwing his weight around.
          他是一個老愛對人頤指氣使的霸道傢伙。

8. Richard's note
	- Exercise
     Richard’s number one “secret” to greater productivity is to keep fit and exercise. 
     Exercise increases energy levels, helps you to sleep better and improves your focus and concentration. 

	- Keeping lists
		 Richard believes in always keeping track and organizing your tasks and ideas in lists.

	- To be productive you should love what you do
     Focus on activities that you enjoy and are a really good at. 
     Try to delegate or outsource everything else.
		 I don’t think of work as work and play as play. It’s all living.
		 
	- Don’t get the lawyers or accountants involved too early

	- Hands off delegation
	   This is an obvious one for Richard. 
	   Running 400 companies it would be absolutely impossible for him to handle the details himself. 

	- Set big audacious goals
		 So you accomplished all your tasks for the day, were you productive? Possibly not. 
		 Productivity is not about accomplishing a list of tasks. 
		 It’s about achieving the big important tasks that make the biggest difference in your life. 
		 The concept of trying to keep control of everything in your life and to get everything finished is potentially LIMITING to your productivity.

		 Instead aim high and focus on the few things that make the biggest difference in your life. 
		 If you aim high then even if you fall way short of your goal you will still accomplish a lot more than if you never set audacious goals in the first place.

		 My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them.

      有一點像美國人說的"Listen up" 、"Look."這些口頭禪。
      
    - Do the needful : Needful是很老的字，英語系國家沒有人用了。當印度人說"Kindly do the needful"，意思是"Please do this, it is necessary."

14.  Remember the acronym HALT—don’t give feedback if you are Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. 
      Since candor and feedback involve other people, you’ll likely encounter misunderstandings, hurt feelings, or other conflict. 
      Don’t expect feedback to always feel natural or easy. 
      A little discomfort and a few mistakes means you’re on the right path.

16. - To & For    
	    當有移轉物品的情形或是某人將東西交給某人時，就會產生recepient(接收者)，這時會用到to跟for，而用法也有不同：
	    當句子中有 motion(動作)出現，包括：give、pass、throw…等等，就要使用to，
	    例如：I give the pen to her. (我把原子筆給她)，句子當中出現了 “give"(給)這個motion(動作)，所以用 to。
	    與motion(動作)相對的，當你沒有 move(移動)任何東西，沒有東西經過交換或轉手的時後，這是就是一個situation(情況)，要使用for，
	    例如：It is for her. (這是給她的)，句子當中沒有出現 motion(動作)，只有 be動詞 “is"，這時就把它看作一個 situation(情況)，用 for。
	    
	    若你是個人闡述自己意見的話，就用to me。若是有人和你在爭論或不同意見時，你要表達自己的看法時，就用for me。

    - churn out : 【口】大量生產某物(通常質量惡劣); 粗製濫造
    - crap / morph / quirk / carving
    - I'm currently a little over-committed and won't be able to make the time right now.
      I'll be sure to fit this in as soon as possible.
      The terms you are offering will not work for us.
      That's not my area of expertise.
    - plummet / euphoric / disastrous / faux pas
    - blunder / stumble / skittish / exert / schmooz / rehearsed answer / debilitating 
    - eagerness : She shows great eagerness for success 
    - have the upper hand :
      Truly confident people always have the upper hand over the doubtful and the skittish because "they inspire others and they make things happen".
      
20. - Affect vs. Effect - 
      To make these words even more confusing than they already are, both can be used as either a noun or a verb.
      Let’s start with the verbs. 
      Affect means to influence something or someone; 
      effect means to accomplish something. 
      "Your job was affected by the organizational restructuring" but "These changes will be effected on Monday."
      
      As a noun, 
      an effect is the result of something: "The sunny weather had a huge effect on sales." 
      It’s almost always the right choice because the noun affect refers to an emotional state and is rarely used outside of psychological circles: "The patient’s affect was flat."
      
    - Lie vs. Lay - 
      We’re all pretty clear on the lie that means an untruth. 
      It’s the other usage that trips us up. 
      Lie also means to recline: "Why don’t you lie down and rest?" 
      Lay requires an object: "Lay the book on the table." 
      Lie is something you can do by yourself, but you need an object to lay.
      
      It’s more confusing in the past tense. 
      The past tense of lie is—you guessed it—lay: "I lay down for an hour last night." 
      And the past tense of lay is laid: “I laid the book on the table.”
      
    - Bring vs. Take - 
      Bring and take both describe transporting something or someone from one place to another, 
      but the correct usage depends on the speaker’s point of view. 
      
      Somebody brings something to you, but you take it to somewhere else: 
      "Bring me the mail, then take your shoes to your room."
      
      Just remember, if the movement is toward you, use bring; 
      if the movement is away from you, use take.
      
21. What Genuinely Confident People Do Differently :       
			Truly confident people always have the upper hand over the doubtful and the skittish because they inspire others and they make things happen.

      Your mentality has a powerful effect on your ability to succeed is seen in the results of a recent study that confident people earn higher wages and get promoted more quickly than anyone else.

      Indeed, confident people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. 
      Yet, they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves.

			It's a labor of love that they pursue behind the scenes, every single day.
      And while what people are influenced by changes with the season, the unique habits of truly confident people remain constant. 
      Their focused pursuit is driven by these habits that you can emulate and absorb:

      They speak with certainty. 
      	It’s rare to hear the truly confident utter phrases such as “Um,” “I’m not sure,” and “I think.” Confident people speak assertively because they know that it’s difficult to get people to listen to you if you can’t deliver your ideas with conviction.

			They seek out small victories. 
			  Confident people like to challenge themselves and compete, even when their efforts yield small victories. 
			  Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. 
			  The increase in androgen receptors increases the influence of testosterone, 
			  which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle future challenges. 
			  When you have a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months.

      They exercise. 
        A study conducted at the Eastern Ontario Research Institute found that people who exercised twice a week for 10 weeks felt more competent socially, academically, and athletically. 
        They also rated their body image and self-esteem higher. 
        Best of all, rather than the physical changes in their bodies being responsible for the uptick in confidence, it was the immediate, endorphin-fueled positivity from exercise that made all the difference.

      They don't seek attention. 
        People are turned off by those who are desperate for attention. 
        Confident people know that being yourself is much more effective than trying to prove that you’re important. 
        People catch on to your attitude quickly and are more attracted to the right attitude than what, or how many, people you know. 
        Confident people always seem to bring the right attitude.

      Confident people are masters of attention diffusion. 
        When they’re receiving attention for an accomplishment, they quickly shift the focus to all the people who worked hard to help get them there. 
        They don’t crave approval or praise because they draw their self-worth from within.

      They don't pass judgment. 
        Confident people don’t pass judgment on others because they know that everyone has something to offer, 
        and they don’t need to take other people down a notch in order to feel good about themselves. 
        Comparing yourself to other people is limiting. 
        Confident people don’t waste time sizing people up and worrying about whether or not they measure up to everyone they meet.

      They get their happiness from within. 
        Happiness is a critical element of confidence, because in order to be confident in what you do, 
        you have to be happy with who you are. 
        People who brim with confidence derive their sense of pleasure and satisfaction from their own accomplishments, 
        as opposed to what other people think of their accomplishments.

      They listen more than they speak. 
        People with confidence listen more than they speak because they don’t feel as though they have anything to prove. 
        Confident people know that by actively listening and paying attention to others, they are much more likely to learn and grow. 
        Instead of seeing interactions as opportunities to prove themselves to others, they focus on the interaction itself, because they know that this is a far more enjoyable and productive approach to people.

		  They take risks. 
		    When confident people see an opportunity, they take it. 
		    Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, they ask themselves, "What’s stopping me? Why can’t I do that?" and they go for it. 
		    Fear doesn’t hold them back because they know that if they never try, they will never succeed.

      They aren't afraid to be wrong. 
        Confident people aren’t afraid to be proven wrong. 
        They like putting their opinions out there to see if they hold up because they learn a lot from the times they are wrong and other people learn from them when they’re right. 
        Self-assured people know what they are capable of and don’t treat being wrong as a personal slight.

      They celebrate other people's successes. 
        Insecure people constantly doubt their relevance, and because of this, 
        they try to steal the spotlight and criticize others in order to prove their worth. 
        
        Confident people, on the other hand, aren’t worried about their relevance because they draw their self-worth from within. 
        Instead of insecurely focusing inward, confident people focus outward, which allows them to see all the wonderful things that other people bring to the table. 
        Praising people for their contributions is a natural result of this.

22. - complimentary bus (n.) 接駁車
      在機場看到這個字就跟 shuttle bus 一樣是接駁車喔！complimentary 除了有讚美的意思以外，也有代表免費的意思。
      This shampoo package comes with a complimentary travel set!（這個洗髮精還免費贈送旅行組呢！）
    - compact (n.) 小型汽車 / (adj.) 小巧的
      如果需要租車，人數沒有太多，可以租一台小轎車。

    - branch (n.) 分公司 , 總公司叫 head office，分公司就叫做 branch office。
    - drop off (ph.) 讓…下車 , 請某人放你在哪裡下車時，可以用這個 drop someone off 的片語，非常實用喔！
      I asked the taxi driver to drop me off at the airport.（我請司機讓我在機場下車。）
      
		- 我們會play basketball（打籃球）、play badminton（打羽毛球），在很多運動前面會用play，但是做瑜珈，英文的動詞是do，"do yoga"是做瑜珈。
     （O）I do yoga on a weekly basis. 我每週做瑜珈。
      英文有三個動詞可以表示去做某種運動，go、play、do，三個不同的動詞後面接的運動性質也大不相同。
      1. go
         接在go後面的運動，都要加ing，像是go swimming游泳、go bowling打保齡球、go running跑步，
         有時候也不一定是運動，而是活動，像go shopping逛街、go fishing釣魚。
         哪些運動要用go呢? 所以只要是要到某個特別地方去做的運動，我們就用go。

      2.play
         有比賽性質的運動，團體競賽、球類運動都用play。
         打電動叫做play computer games，下西洋棋用play chess，這些運動都有競爭的本質。
      
      3.do
         Do後面加運動，指的你一個可以單獨完成的運動，
         而且這種運動的目的經常是為了養生、強身，目的不在競賽，像瑜珈、太極、有氧運動之類的活動。

      4. Do sports還是play sports？Practice可以嗎？
         假如是籠統的sports，要用do sports還是play sports都可以。
         英國人習慣用do sports，美國人愛用play sports。來看對話例句：

         Q：What sports do you do？（你做什麼運動？）
         A：I play tennis（我打網球。）

         我們也常聽到學生談到做運動時用"practice"。可以用practice代替do或play嗎？

         Practice的意思是「練習」，在西班牙文裡，他們真的就講"practice sports"，英文聽起來不太自然。
         因為在英文裡practice有「練習」、「準備」，train的意思，例如：

         The team is practicing for tomorrow's competition.（團隊在為明天的賽事做準備。）
				 我們當然可以practice yoga、practice Tai Chi，強調是在「練習」，意思和do又有一點差別了。      

    - Take drugs最常見的解釋就是「吸毒」，當然，老外最常用use drugs來指「吸毒」。
      為了避免人想入非非，服藥就用「take medicine」。
      I have to take medicine. （O）


    1.你回來之前我會代理你的職務。
      I will take your job until you get back.（X）
      I will fill in for you until you get back.（O）
      聽到你這麼說，同事可能就不敢去休假了，因為"take your job"意味著你要取代他的工作。
      暫代別人的工作，有一個很管用的片語，叫做"fill in for"。
      Fill in原意是填空，那人不在，你就補了進去，意思契合，for後面加一個人。

    2.我的父母親是自由戀愛結婚的。
      Our parents were free love and then married.（X）
      My parents’ marriage was on the basis of romantic love.（O）

      Free是自由，love是戀愛，很多人想當然耳free love是自由戀愛，西方人根本沒有媒妁之言、所有的戀愛都是自由戀愛。
      "Free love"指「自由性愛，不愛婚姻約束的兩性」。維基百科上的解釋是：
      Free love is a social movement that rejects marriage, which is seen as a form of social and financial bondage.
      （Free love是一個拒絕婚姻的社會運動，藉此擺脫社會和財務的束縛。）自由戀愛不好說成英文，可以轉換一下，他們是以戀愛為基礎結婚的。

     3.總經理下班了。
       The general manager is not working at this moment.（X）
       The general manager is out of work.（X）
       The general manager has got off work. （O）

       當我們說一樣東西not working，意思是它不靈光了、壞掉了。例如：The computer is not working. （電腦有問題。）
       當我們說某人"out of work"意思是他離開工作、失業了，unemployed、jobless的意思。
       下班的英文是"Get off work"。

23. Let one’s hair down也可指態度上的不再設防，亦即「全然放鬆自己」或者「完全不再拘謹」。
    除此之外，這個英文成語還可指談吐上的不再設防，亦即「吐露真言」或者「道出心事」。
    
    dividend :【經】紅利；股息 
    The company declared a large dividend at the end of the year .   公司在年底宣布紅利甚豐。
    
    doomsday : 世界的末日;危機時刻; 危難事件
      grooming / tuition / flourishing / solvent

24. here today, gone tomorrow : said about something that lasts only a short time
      A lot of new internet companies are here today and gone tomorrow.
      
      if something or someone is here today, gone tomorrow, they only exist or stay in one place for a short time.
       He had a string of girlfriends, but they were always here today, gone tomorrow.
25. lose one’s temper : 發飆
    get angry僅能用來表示「某人生氣了」的意思，
    如果要描述更強烈的生氣程度，像是「動怒、發飆」，可以用lose one’s temper來表示，
    而lose it是更為口語化的說法，
    如果想要用英文表示「暴跳如雷」的意思，可以說fly off the handle。
    其它與生氣相關的英文說法，還有表示「抓狂」的flip out，
    「勃然大怒」的blow up、blow one’s top，
    「氣到發火」的hit the ceiling，以及
    「怒氣衝天、大發雷霆」的go ballistic。    
    The boss lost his temper when he saw the monthly sales report. 老闆在看了月銷售報表，就整個人動怒了。
    Mike lost it when he saw his girlfriend kissing another guy. 邁克在看到自己的女友親吻了另一個男人，就發飆了。
    
    Some people equate good listening with sitting silently, nodding, making eye contact, 
    and, when the speaker is done, paraphrasing what you heard. 
    But these things are only part of what makes someone feel that you heard them. 
    The best listeners go deeper by trying to understand the substance of what the other person is saying. 
    Doing this requires that you ask questions to clarify your understanding and push the other person to better articulate their position, 
    examine any assumptions they’re making, and see the issues in new light. 
    You should also try to empathize with and validate any emotions the speaker is conveying. 
    Once you’ve made sure the person feels supported, you can offer some thoughts and ideas about the topic that could be useful to the other person. 
    Just be careful not to highjack the conversation so that you or your agenda becomes the subject of the discussion.
