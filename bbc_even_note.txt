    -1. 目標要可靠，期望要實際
				Solid goal, practical expectation.
        Before setting a goal for your team, imagine what it'd be like if you're going to do it all by yourself. 
        Is it going to be hard or is it going to be easy? 
        After understanding your goals thoroughly, you can have a more practical expectation. 

     2. 建立團隊互信
        Build trust within your team.
        Integration within a team always depends on trust. 
        Transparent and honest communication will not only benefit the team's efficiency but also the corporate culture.

		 3. 解決導向
         Solution is the point.
 				When encountering a problem, or when team members make mistakes, remember not to focus on the problem itself but the solution to the issue. This is how employees learn to solve things themselves.

		 4. 創造部屬的自信心
				Build (A) self-esteem in (B) underlings.
        Pay attention to how you make others feel. 
        An MVP in your team will never be just obedient, but will be confident and understand his or her own value.

     5. 好的領導人不獨裁
        A good leader is not an autocrat.
        Being a competent leader doesn't mean you are going to throw your weight around. Finding a balance between being firm and being reasonable is a lesson that every leader should learn.
        做一個能幹的領導者並不代表要對他人頤指氣使。在立場堅定以及合乎情理間找到平衡點是優質領導人必學的一道課題。

     6. 懂得賞識很重要
         Appreciation is important.
         Direct and plain feedback is necessary. So is appreciation. Encourage the positive cycle by telling the employee exactly what he did well.

     7. 領導人也須「服務他人」
         Leaders need to serve others.
         There is a fallacy that the leader's job is to command. 
         Actually, a leader's main mission is to "serve." Offer the necessary information and give your team a hand when they are needed; that's how you make the team willing to support you in the same way.
 
     片語教學
       1. Under promise and over deliver
       不過度承諾，表現超乎期待 , Promise是承諾，Deliver是履行。

       Remember the principle of under promise and over deliver, and never make a promise that you cannot fulfill.

       2. Throw one's weight around 逞威風
          指對人濫用自己的權威，表現跋扈或盛氣凌人。

	1. Exercise
     Richard’s number one “secret” to greater productivity is to keep fit and exercise. 
     Exercise increases energy levels, helps you to sleep better and improves your focus and concentration. 

	2. Keeping lists
		 Richard believes in always keeping track and organizing your tasks and ideas in lists.

	3. To be productive you should love what you do
     Focus on activities that you enjoy and are a really good at. 
     Try to delegate or outsource everything else.
		 I don’t think of work as work and play as play. It’s all living.
		 
	4. Don’t get the lawyers or accountants involved too early

	5. Hands off delegation
	   This is an obvious one for Richard. 
	   Running 400 companies it would be absolutely impossible for him to handle the details himself. 

	6. Set big audacious goals
		 So you accomplished all your tasks for the day, were you productive? Possibly not. 
		 Productivity is not about accomplishing a list of tasks. 
		 It’s about achieving the big important tasks that make the biggest difference in your life. 
		 The concept of trying to keep control of everything in your life and to get everything finished is potentially LIMITING to your productivity.

		 Instead aim high and focus on the few things that make the biggest difference in your life. 
		 If you aim high then even if you fall way short of your goal you will still accomplish a lot more than if you never set audacious goals in the first place.

		 My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them.

	    例如：It is for her. (這是給她的)，句子當中沒有出現 motion(動作)，只有 be動詞 “is"，這時就把它看作一個 situation(情況)，用 for。
	    
	    若你是個人闡述自己意見的話，就用to me。若是有人和你在爭論或不同意見時，你要表達自己的看法時，就用for me。
