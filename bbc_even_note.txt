        假如直述句的主詞是 Something, Everything, Anything,或 Nothing, 則tag的代名詞一律用 it.
        Nothing's wrong, is it?  (以No-開頭的句子 , 由於是否定形, 故後面的tag 用肯定形動詞)
        
        假如直述句的主詞是 Somebody/Someone, Everybody/Everyone, Anybody/Anyone or Nobody/No-one,
        則tag的代名詞一律用 they.
        Nobody's perfect, are they?

        假如tag的目的是在希望對方認同或附合, 則應唸成下降語調 ,

                       以 No 回答否定形直述句
          A:You can't please everybody, can you?
          B:No.

     2. 直述句 + tag : 表達其它含意
        在肯定直述句後附加一個肯定形的 tag (或否定+否定), 此時 tag 要唸成上揚語調 ; 
        這種用法時常帶有惱怒或嘲諷對方的意味 , 特別是以 So... 或 You think ... 等開頭的句子.
        e.g.
          So you're going to keep saying "Hm!" to me, are you?
          You think this is intelligent, do you?
          
     3. 祈使句 + tag

        Just sit down and be quiet, can't you?
