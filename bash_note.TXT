[export]
  讓變數可在不同process 間互享 ==> export VAR
  function 也可以export  ==> export -f myfunc

[compgen -k]
  What keywords are in Bash
  
[.bash_profile] is read when Bash is involed as a login shell
[.bashrc] is executed when a new shell is started <== so don't export variable, like PATH in .bashrc it.
  but because aliases and functions are not normally exported, you would define those in your .bashrc.
  And those aren't growing like PATH=$, PATH value would be.

[source v. .]
". " : Dot space is the same as using the command source.
"." : will execute by a new process

[alias / unalias]
  alias ls='ls --color=auto'
  unalias ls

[echo]
  -n / -e / -E

[typeset]
  typeset -i x
    let x++; let y=x**2; let x=x*3; let x*=5, ...
    
[declare]
  declare -l uppercase values in the variable are converted to lowercase.
  declare -u lowercase values in the variable are converted to uppercase.  
  declare -r variable is made read-only.

  seq 1 5 # prints 1 2 3 4 5
  "string" v. `command`
  for num in `seq 1 5`  
  generate sequences with {A..Z}, {1..10}, etc...
  
  for d in $(<data_file)
  #loops over space/newline
  #separated data in data_file
  
  for j in *.c
  #making a list with file globbing
  
  for f in $(find . -name *.c)
  #using a command to generate a list
  
[nl v. cat]

find /etc 2>/dev/null
