1. Why Unit Test ?
   - Reduce bugs.
   - Good documentation
   - Improve code quality
   - Reduce code to change

2. understand how much and what to test.
   
   Unit testing / Integration Unit test 
   Functional Unit test (Tester) / System testing (Q&A)
   Stress testing / Load testing / Usability testing
   
   
3. Ensure clear & focused : what the test is about , clear test name.

   Test any public method : 
      They should not fail
      There are many tests for many parameters.
      Separate test methods are used for many "conditions" and "expections".
      
   Group Tests according behavior
     Group unit tests into classes - test cases.
     Typically , one test case per application class.
     
   Validate one thing at a time.
   
4. LocalTest (not coupled with Android dependencies)
     - JUnit API  @Test
     
     
     
   Instrumented Tests
